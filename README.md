# Weight Comparison using NHANES Data

**_Overview_**

This project analyzes weight distributions for adult males and females using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A box-and-whisker plot is created to visually compare the weight distributions of the two groups.

**_Dataset_**

The dataset used in this project includes two CSV files:

nhanes_adult_male_bmx_2020.csv: Weight data for adult males.

nhanes_adult_female_bmx_2020.csv: Weight data for adult females.

These files can be found in the My Drive folder of Google Drive.

**_Setup and Execution_**

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Google Colab (optional)

Libraries

_Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:_
numpy

pandas

matplotlib

google.colab (if using Google Colab)

_You can install these libraries using pip:_

bash

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

**Steps**

**Mount Google Drive:** Ensure your Google Drive is mounted if using Google Colab.

**Define File Paths:** Set the correct paths to the dataset files.

**Read Data:** Load the CSV files into pandas DataFrames.

**Extract Weights:** Extract the weight data from the appropriate columns.

**Plot Data:** Create a box-and-whisker plot to compare male and female weights.

**Example Code**
Here's a snippet of the main code used in the project:

python

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from google.colab import drive

# Mount Google Drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Define file paths
male_file_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/nhanes_adult_male_bmx_2020.csv'

female_file_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/nhanes_adult_female_bmx_2020.csv'

# Read the CSV files into pandas DataFrames, handling potential issues
male_df = pd.read_csv(male_file_path, on_bad_lines='skip')

female_df = pd.read_csv(female_file_path, on_bad_lines='skip')

# Extract the 'BMXWT' column from the DataFrames
male_weights = male_df['BMXWT'].dropna().astype(float)

female_weights = female_df['BMXWT'].dropna().astype(float)

# Create a box-and-whisker plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

plt.boxplot([female_weights, male_weights], labels=['Female', 'Male'])

plt.title('Weight Comparison: Female vs. Male')

plt.ylabel('Weight (kg)')

plt.show()

**_Discussion of Results_**
The box-and-whisker plot visually compares the distributions of female and male weights.

Key observations:

The median weight for males (indicated by the line inside the box) is noticeably higher than that of females.

The interquartile range (IQR), represented by the box's height, is larger for males, suggesting a wider spread of weights among males.

The whiskers extend further for males, indicating a greater range of weights, including potential outliers.

Both distributions appear to be slightly skewed to the right, with potential outliers on the higher end of the weight scale.

Overall, the plot suggests that males tend to have higher weights and a greater variability in weight compared to females in this dataset.
